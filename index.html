Took some time researching phaser, like the functions that come with it etc, also found games that were made using phaser,
looked through alot of tutorials, I found that they all had the same idea which was to create the image, create variables that
tie in with the image. Give the variables properties and to pass the variables through functions to make them move, then add
them to the game world. Then to make sure that they fit in the game world dementions that you have created. 
I did a tutorial on how to create a game. I chose the asteroid game because i thought it would be pretty beginner friendly since that games been
around since the 90s. At first everything was pretty easy to understand. I created the gameProperties to create how big the screen
would be for the game, or how big the dimentions of the game would be. Then i found pictures online to change up the graphics of
the game since the images that it was using kind of seemed too 90s like just stick figures.
This part was easy but time consuming since i had to find pictures, convert them, see how they would look on screen. Make
the game boundaries bigger so that i could fit in bigger images because if it was too small the images would be to blurry to 
really see what they were. Then after i found images of which i think would work well with the game I used gimp to make the images 
smaller. I chose a pictureof a round ship with 3 sides to be the picture of my "asteroids" because i new that they would have to 
spin like asteroids. Then i created the largest image of the enemy ship, a medium picture and a small picture so that when game 
was "finished" and i could shoot, they would split into the smaller pictures through a function. Then 
created the properties of the user ship.I learned alot of the built in functions like velocity, speed, drag etc. I did the same
things for the bullets, the Large, medium, and small enemy ships, as well as how many enemy ships would be alloud on screen at one
time etc. Then the keyboard function like left, right, shoot, and accelerate. Added it to the game state. i began to understand why 
it is important to keep code organized. for example having all the variables above, so
you can call them into functions. Then the validations etc. I was and still am only used to doing things with very little line
of code but this gave me i think a taste of the real world and why it is so important to keep everything organized or have an
actual style of writing code. Alot of the code felt overwhelming because there were so many paremeters and arguments that was needed
to pass through for validation. Even though the tutorial shows you how to do everything alot of the things it was going over
did not seem very familiar especially the physics part of the game, i had to research what some of the built in methods did 
as well as some of the equations so that everything stays in the bounds of the paremeters of the game world so i 
could actually understand waht everything was doing. Everything was ok.. to understand like the properties of all the variables etc,
 it was hard to understand the math portion of the code in like the validation what everything was actually doing
  Especially the parts where you set the rotations and the anchors of the enemyShips with the randoms. Another part that was
 confusing  was the amount of properties everything had. I thought that when 
we create the variables you can just call the actually variable through everything because of some of the other tutorials. We called properties of
preety much everything. for example the firing rate was set at 100, but i had to call that function so that if i fired a certain 
amount of bullets it didnt shoot more. Then i had to put physics on the bullets so that they fire from a certain part of the
image itself so it looks like it is shooting from the front of the image. Then how the bullet traveled so that if you shoot
while the user ship is moving it would keep heading in a certain direction at the exact point of movement from the user controls.
The life span of bullets, the intervals of bullets. Also even remebering what properties you gave and the names, having
to keep looking for the properties you created in all this code. The tutorial gave a vivid image of how a game programmer things
because of the order of the code. For every property there was also validation and physics that followed. Then to bring the game
to life you pass the variable into function to bring into the game world. Also adding to the codes and functions. For example when
you die, you would think you just die, but no you die, theres a 5 second interval to pop up again, you pop up in a certain part of the
dementions, the number indicating how many lives has to go down, being invicible for the 5 second period that you are dead. You
would think that you would just do this all at once, but i realized for all these things to happen others variables and functions
have to be created first.   
All in all i dont want to be a game developer. I understand now why
math is so important in the world of coding, especially in building games.
